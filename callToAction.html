    <p id ='desc'>These two charts show what percent of certain demographics vote. The conclusion to be reached with the age chart is clear, young people do not vote nearly as much as older people. This is a problem because this disparity in represention is fundamentally undemocratic. The young are just as effected by the government as the old, but have a significantly reduced say in how it runs. Of course, if you are a young person, voting would be a good way to help change these numbers, but below is a link to The Alliance for Youth Action. Volunteering with them in one of their many drives to get out the vote would be a great way to give young people more of a voice in our political system.</p>

    <p id = 'desc'>The Race chart shows an unexpected disparity. Generally all the demographics hover at about the same rate of participation, but for some reason hispanic people including those who also identify as white vote much less than people who describe themselves as hispanic but not white. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the "get out the vote" programs for hispanics has been successful, however these programs don't tend to focus on hispanics who also identify as white. There is a less clear path to solving this problem, but the easiest way to start is by getting involved in structure of Latinx voter registration drives and make sure that they don't exclude this subsection of the demographic. Make some phone calls, talk to people you know, help break through the barrier of apathy that so many people of all sorts have involving politics.</p>
