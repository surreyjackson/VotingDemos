<h2>Electoral Data:</h2>
<a class='source' href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/voting-and-registration/p20-580.html">Tables 4b and 4c of the Census Bureau's 2016 General Election Data</a>
<p class='desc'>The Census Bureau is probably the most trustworthy source on this topic, given that they are attached to the body that actually carries out elections. These tables contain the total amount of votes counted in each state, the percentage of citizens who voted, and it also breaks down that data into specific demographics. 4b focuses on race and gender data, while 4c breaks the information down into age groups.</p>

<h2>Geographical Data:</h2>
<a class='source' href="https://eric.clst.org/tech/usgeojson/">Eric Celeste's United States GeoJSON Data</a>
<p class="desc">I trust this source for two reasons: first, when plugged into the code to create a map of the United States, it created it. Second, this site was reccomended by my wonderful computer science professor, Michael Bradshaw. This contains the data for polygons representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia.</p>
